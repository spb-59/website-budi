Once all Budi Orders have been picked/packed, package dimensions must be specified for every order in the Budi Session.

Packaging on hand is required to request a fulfilment quote. Packaging options can be added in Preferences.

Yes, Budi Orders can be picked/packed at any time. However, pick/packing orders before a Session can cause difficulty ensuring parcels are together for aggregated fulfilment. You may find it easier to handle aggregated fulfilments if all Budi Orders in a Session are picked/packed together.                        </AccordionContent>
